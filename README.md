- What is mathematics? 
Answer: Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape, quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do. It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, including mobile devices, computers, software, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering and even sports.


- What is mathematical thinking?
Answer: Mathematical thinking is a way of thinking to involve mathematics to solve real-world problems. A key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside of the box, which is very important in today's world

The Scince of Patterns 
different types of patterns for example:
- Arithmetic 
- Number Theory
- Geometry
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra 
- Logic
- Probability
- Topology
- Fractal Geometry

# Why Proofs?
* Proofs a long formal meaningless mainpulations

# The Main Goal in Proofs
1 - learn by examples how to understand proofs
2 - How to invent proofs
3 - how to explain proofs 
4 - How to enjoy proofs

first exmaple of proof:
Theorem: a chessboard has 64 squares 8 multiplied by 8 
two opposite corners be tiled with black and white squares, and the remaining squares be tiled with white and black squares in an alternating pattern.
Proof:
1 - The chessboard has 64 squares
2 - The chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns
3 - black and white cells, 4 black and 4 white cells in each row
4 - opposite corners are say black
5 - 30 black and 32 white, at least two white remain
